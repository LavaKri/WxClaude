# Open questions and improvements

The other files of `docs/` describe what is true and decided. Everything that is still to decide,
to verify or to improve lives here, and nowhere else. When an item is settled, move the result to
the file it belongs to and delete it from this one.

## To decide

Nothing at the moment.

## To verify

- **UI Automation notifications and JAWS.** They reach NVDA and Narrator; test JAWS, with a focusable
  progress field as a fallback if they do not.
- **Reading the usage gauge without sending a message** (no way found yet).
- **Title entry of a generated title**: the reader expects an `ai-title` entry with an `aiTitle`
  field; only `custom-title` / `customTitle` was seen in real files.
- **Effort in the session files**: only `low` and `medium` were seen. Are `xhigh` and `max` written
  the same way, and are `effort` and `perTurnEffort` always equal?
- **Subscription use.** Driving `claude -p` from a custom front end with a subscription login may
  be restricted by the usage policy of the provider (an API key is the safe path). Check the current
  terms.

## Improvements not done yet

- Context menu on a message (copy, show the tools used, a table, a link), see
  `conversation-display.md`.
- Delete a conversation (the menu item is greyed).
- After a turn the view is rebuilt from the session file; the answer titles then show the effort
  written in the file, and none for a model that ignores it (haiku).
- Permission questions: with `-p` a tool that needs permission is denied (milestone 4).
